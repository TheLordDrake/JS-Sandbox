    External JavaScript Advantages
    Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
    To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head></head>

    <body>
        <h1>A Web Page</h1>
        <p id='demo'>A paragraph</p>
        <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    </body>
</html>


<!--
    Uses path to external script file.
    Can use full or relative path.

    E.G. Can use;
    ./js/myScript.js
-->
<script src='js/myScript.js'></script>
